# Python_climate_Applications
**Practical Application on Climate Variability Studies**
• Did PCA(Principal Component Analysis) analysis and used various multivariate Gaussian fitting for
climate data and found valuable insights.

• Did Time Series Analysis, CCA(Canonical Correlation Analysis, Wavelet Transform, Power Spectral
Analysis and Forecasting.
Used NC files and LSmask to plot spatial and temporal variabilities.

• Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, MatplotLib, SkLearn, SciPy, Plotly
